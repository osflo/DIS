    "\n",
    "We would like to develop a rule-based approach to disambiguate the meaning of the term \"Apple\" in sentences into the two possible meanings **Tech** and **Fruit**. The rules use keyphrases i.e., n-grams of words, as features in their conditions. In the approach **only the top-k keyphrases** are considered. Before forming keyphrases, the words are stemmed, stopwords are not considered and uppercase words are converted to lowercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a possible rule would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "\tif \"fruit\" and \"facebook\" then \"Tech\"\n",
    "\n",
    "meaning that if a sentence that contains the term \"Apple\" also contains the unigrams \"fruit\" and \"facebook\" then the meaning of \"Apple\" should be the Apple technology company (**Tech**).\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally we write such rules as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t{k1,...,kn} -> Tech or {k1,...,kn} -> Fruit\n",
    "    \n",
    "where k1,..,kn are arbitrary word n-grams and a set {k1,...,kn} is considered as an item set.\n",
    "\n",
    "As **training data** we obtain 10 sentences containing \"Apple\" that have been labelled by their meaning as T(ech) or F(ruit).\n",

    "    An apple is a fruit and good for health. (F)\n",

    "\n",
    "We define the **confidence** of a rule {k1,...,kn} -> T as the fraction between the number of sentences that contain all keyphrases k1,...,kn with label T over the number of sentences with all keyphrases k1,...,kn. Similar definition for {k1,...,kn} -> F.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define the **support** of an itemset as the number of sentences that contain all the n-grams in the itemset.\n",

    "1. Without considering the word \"apple\", determine the keyphrases with minimum document frequency of 2.\n",

    "3. Determine all rules that have a minimum support of 2 and a minimum confidence of 70%. Provide for each rule its support and confidence values. \n",
    "4. Explain how the apriori property could be exploited in optimizing the computation of those itemsets for composite keyphrases.\n",
